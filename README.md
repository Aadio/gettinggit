# Getting Git
[Getting Git](https://gettinggit.com) is a comprehensive video series from `git init` to *Git Master*. This repository is used in *Part 4 - Sharing Work* to allow viewers to sign the [registry](registry.txt) and leave a [testimonial](testimonials.md).

In addition, some of the video transcripts have also been adapted so everyone may [learn Git](https://gettinggit.com/learn).
